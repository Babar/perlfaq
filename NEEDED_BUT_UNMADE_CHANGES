This document sits aside the perlfaq files as a scratchpad for things
that should change, but for some reason haven't. Please use this 
syntax (and leave the committer annotation to subversion):

	<severity>perlfaq<number> - <comment>

	Severity

		! - important change needed soon 
		? - something that might need work, but not sure
		. - change this at some point, but no big deal

		& - needs a code change
		" - needs a prose change

		\ - backwards compatibility change (e.g. for 5.6)
		/ - forwards compatibility change (e.g. for 5.10)

		# - resolved, but keep in list anyway just in case

		- - candidate for deletion
		+ - candidate for addition

For example:


Important change to text:

	!"perlfaq5 - The question says foo, but should say bar

Is that code right:

	?&perlfaq4 - Does that really calculate foo?
		
Delete this question:

	-perlfaq3 - Question "How do I foo?" no longer needed with Perl5

Add this question

	+perlfaq1 - Add "Why Doens't anyone ever listen to me?"

=cut

# put some parsing, reporting code here

__END__
?perlfaq7 - remove Switch.pm mention
