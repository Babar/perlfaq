=head1 NAME

perlfaq_toc.pl -- create perlfaq.pod from /perlfaq\d.pod/

=head1 SYNOPSIS

in the same directory as the /perlfaq\d.pod/ files:

	perlfaq_toc.pod > perlfaq.pod

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The perlfaq.pod file is a table of contents of the various
perlfaq files, and has previously been maintained separately.
It should be able to be created from the other files, and this
is my first attempt at that.

=head1 TO DO

* move the pre- and post- amble to templates

* the POD parsing is rather simple-minded and can be improved

=head1 BUGS

* it can't handle question titles that appear on multiple lines
in the perlfaq pod.

=head1 NAME

perlfaq - frequently asked questions about Perl ($Date$)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The perlfaq is divided into several documents based on topics.  A table
of contents is at the end of this document.

=head2 Where to get the perlfaq

Extracts of the perlfaq are posted regularly to
comp.lang.perl.misc.  It is available on many web sites:
http://www.perldoc.com/ and http://faq.perl.org/

=head2 How to contribute to the perlfaq

You may mail corrections, additions, and suggestions to
perlfaq-workers@perl.org .  This alias should not be used to
I<ask> FAQs.  It's for fixing the current FAQ. Send
questions to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup.  You can
view the source tree at http://cvs.perl.org/cvsweb/perlfaq/
(which is outside of the main Perl source tree).  The CVS
repository notes all changes to the FAQ.

=head2 What will happen if you mail your Perl programming problems to the authors

Your questions will probably go unread, unless they're
suggestions of new questions to add to the FAQ, in which
case they should have gone to the perlfaq-workers@perl.org
instead.

You should have read section 2 of this faq.  There you would
have learned that comp.lang.perl.misc is the appropriate
place to go for free advice.  If your question is really
important and you require a prompt and correct answer, you
should hire a consultant.

=head1 Credits

The original perlfaq was written by Tom Christiansen, then expanded
by collaboration between Tom and Nathan Torkington.  The current
document is maintained by the perlfaq-workers (perlfaq-workers@perl.org).
Several people have contributed answers, corrections, and comments.
